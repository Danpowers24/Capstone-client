# Application Title: A Description

At the base level, this application allows the user to create and take quizzes. This application was inspired by the need for a way for [PACTS](http://csph.brighamandwomens.org/cultural-dexterity-nih-r01-awarded/) researchers to test surgeons on whether or not they were retaining knowledge from the curriculum the researchers were developing.

1. Run `install command` to install all dependencies
